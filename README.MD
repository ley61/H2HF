# Solving Roothan's equation for the hydrogen molecule

A python code has been written to study the hydrogen molecule numerically.
The core of the program is the definition of the class `H2`, which can be
easily used for different purposes. In the present code an object `H2` is
created at each iteration of a loop, in order to calculate the bonding energy for different values of the internuclei distance.
